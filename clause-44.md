## 44. Resource Exchange

Upon a 2/3+1 majority vote by the then current Block Producers to do so, computer code and/or contracts enabling a "Resource Exchange" for staking an accountâ€™s system resources to a common exchange which leases or rents out said resources to others for a fee (even a zero value fee) and disburses said fees to all resource-staking Members in return for an equal percentage of network income from RAM transaction fees, name bidding fees, or any other fee for commonly owned or managed Telos resources shall be implemented in the Telos Blockchain Network computer code and/or contracts. The form of this Resource Exchange may be modified or removed in the future upon a 2/3+1 majority vote by the then current Block Producers. For as long as funds exist in the Exchange Token Reserve Fund named "exrsrv.tf", funds from that account may be deposited into the Resource Exchange account named "eosio.rex" for disbursement at a rate of 1,000,000 TLOS per month through block 98,000,000; 1,350,000 TLOS per month for blocks 98,000,001 through block 113,000,000; 1,500,000 TLOS per month for blocks 113,000,001 through block 128,000,000; 1,700,000 TLOS per month from block 128,000,001. This rate may be adjusted by a 2/3+1 vote of the Block Producers provided it does not exceed the limits set in Clause 49 "Telos Economic Development".
