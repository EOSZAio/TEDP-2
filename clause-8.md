## 8. Block Producer Nomination, Qualification, and Election

Any Telos Member may self-nominate as a candidate to be a Block Producer by executing the “regproducer” contract and accepting its human-language terms. The Telos blockchain maintains a list of minimum requirements for acting as a Block Producer or Standby Block Producers (the “Block Producer Minimum Requirements”). The 21 block producer candidates currently in compliance with the Block Producer Minimum Requirements receiving the highest weight of Member votes shall serve as Block Producers. Through to block 113,000,000, the 30 block producer candidates currently in compliance with the Block Producer Minimum Requirements and not serving as Block Producers receiving the highest weight of Member votes shall serve as Standby Block Producers. From block 113,000,001, the 21 block producer candidates currently in compliance with the Block Producer Minimum Requirements and not serving as Block Producers receiving the highest weight of Member votes shall serve as Standby Block Producers. Enforcement of compliance with the Block Producer Minimum Requirements shall be by a 2/3+1 vote of the Block Producers.
